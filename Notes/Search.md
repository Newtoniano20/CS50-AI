Like tic tac toe, how can we solve it?

**Terminology:**

- **Agent**: entity that perceives its envoirenment and acts upon that envoirenment
- **State:** a configuration of the agent in an envoirenment
- **Initial State:** Where we begin
- **Actions(s)**, a function that will return the set of actions that can be executed in a state s.
- **Transition model:** Result(s, a) returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s.
- **State Space:** the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions
- **Goal test:** way to determine wheather a given state is a goal state
- **Path Cost:** numerical cost associated with a given path 
- **Optimal Solution**
